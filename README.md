- 🔄 **Full CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete car listings via REST API
- 💾 **SQLite Database** - Free, lightweight database solution

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Flask (Python web framework)
- SQLite (Database)
- Pandas (Excel processing)
- Google Generative AI (Gemini)

### Frontend
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern CSS with animations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Ingest Excel Data to Database

First, make sure your `cars.xlsx` file is in the project root with the following sheets:
- Make-Model-Year
- Make-Model
- Basic Specs
- Engine Specs
- Statistics

Then run the ingestion script:

```bash
python ingest_excel_to_db.py
```

This will create `intelliwheels.db` and populate it with data from all 5 Excel sheets.

### 3. Configure Gemini API Key

Edit `js/main.js` and replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key:

```javascript
const GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key-here";
```

Alternatively, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
```

### 4. Start the Backend Server

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Open the Frontend

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser, or use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or your chosen port)

- Images (image_url, image_urls)
- Ratings (rating, reviews)
- Specifications (specs as JSON)
- Engines (engines as JSON)
- Statistics (statistics as JSON)
- Source tracking (source_sheets)

## Troubleshooting

### Backend not starting
- Make sure port 5000 is not in use
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify Python version (3.7+)

### Database errors
- Run `ingest_excel_to_db.py` to initialize database
- Check that `cars.xlsx` exists and has all 5 sheets

### Chatbot not working
- Verify Gemini API key is set correctly
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure backend server is running

### CORS errors
- Make sure Flask-CORS is installed
- Check that backend is running on correct port
- Verify API base URL in `js/api.js`
